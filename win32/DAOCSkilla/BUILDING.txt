                 DaocSkilla Basic Build Instructions
=======================================================================


----------
 WARNINGS
----------

DaocSkilla is an automation engine for controlling a Dark Age of Camelot
session.  Incorrect settings can cause your character to sell things
from you inventory you want to keep, buy expensive items from a vendor,
or get you killed by 'helping' you attack a hostile purple.  As such:
  
               ********************************
               ***** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK *****
               ********************************

The code and binaries are provided for those who wish to understand the
DAoC protocol, see how automation is achieved, etc.  In other words,
the Excalibur team is not responsible for what you do with the this
application or its source code.
 
--------------
 Requirements
--------------

1.  Borland Delphi (32-bit) http://www.borland.com/
    I use Delphi 6 Enterprise but Personal and Professional also work.
    Delphi 7 should work as well, Delphi 5 probably needs the Indy
    components for the RemoteAdmin unit.
    
2.  WinPCAP 3.0 Runtime http://winpcap.polito.it/
    Required services to read network traffic.  You don't need the
    development stuff, just the driver+DLLs (auto-installer).
    
3.  glWindow Component http://www.cfxweb.net/~delphigl/files/glWindow.zip
    Install this into your IDE via instructions below. You only need this
    if you want to build the OpenGL renderer.

4.  A CVS client (Cygwin CVS, CVSGui, etc)
    Just to get the source.

--------------
    Setup
--------------

1.  Get the win32 source from CVS.  I put the source in an Excalibur
    directory.  Using Cygwin's command line CVS:
    mkdir Excalibur
    cd Excalibur
    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/excalibar login
    (press enter when asked for a password)
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/excalibar co win32

2.  Extract the glWindow component to the Components\glWindow directory
    off your base directory.  Your directory structure should look like this:
    Excalibur\
    Excalibur\win32\
    Excalibur\win32\Components\
    Excalibur\win32\Components\glWindow\
    Excalibur\win32\Components\zlib\
    Excalibur\win32\Common\
    Excalivur\win32\Common\ChatParse\
    Excalivur\win32\Common\DAOCAutomation\
    Excalivur\win32\Common\DAOCInfo\
    Excalibur\win32\Common\PacketSniff\
    Excalibur\win32\DaocSkilla\
    Excalibur\win32\CamelotChatRT\
    etc.

3.  Install the glWindow component in the Delphi IDE.
    a.  Go to the Component menu and select Install Component...
    b.  In the Unit File Name box, browse to and select the
        glWindow.pas
    c.  Package file name isn't important unless you know what you're
        doing.  dclusr.dpk works fine.
    d.  Click OK
    d.  On the Package dialog that comes up next, click the Install
        button.  You should get a message that the glWindow component
        has been registered.
        
4.  Open DAOCSkilla.dpr from the File | Open Project... menu

5.  Run!


-------------
 Optionality
-------------
There are a couple options which can be turned off if they are causing
you troubles in building.  They can be accessed from Project |
Options... window, Directories/Conditionals tab, Conditional Defines
box.  When changing defines, you *MUST* do a "Build all" in order for
the changes to take effect throughout all the code.

OPENGL_RENDERER: Enables the building of all OpenGL-based render
    dialog.  Remove the define to build without it.

DAOC_AUTO_SERVER: Enables the building of the Automation Object for
    TDaocControl.  Needed if you're going to use a macro script.
    Most functions have not been extended to the Automation interface.

REMOTE_ADMIN:  Enables a telnet server in DAOCSkilla that can be
    used to control it when Dark Age is running full screen.
