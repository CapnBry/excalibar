                 DaocSkilla Basic Build Instructions
=======================================================================


----------
 WARNINGS
----------

DaocSkilla is an automation engine for controlling a Dark Age of Camelot
session.  Incorrect settings can cause your character to sell things
from you inventory you want to keep, buy expensive items from a vendor,
or get you killed by 'helping' you attack a hostile purple.  As such:
  
               ********************************
               ***** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK *****
               ********************************

The code and binaries are provided for those who wish to understand the
DAoC protocol, see how automation is achieved, etc.  In other words,
the Excalibur team is not responsible for what you do with the this
application or its source code.
 
--------------
 Requirements
--------------

1.  Borland Delphi (32-bit) http://www.borland.com/
    I use Delphi 6 Enterprise but Personal and Professional also work.
    Delphi 7 should work as well, Delphi 5 probably needs the Indy
    components for the RemoteAdmin unit.  Make sure you include the
     "Program Files/Sample Applications" feature since we use the SpinEdit
     control from that group.
    
2.  A CVS client (Cygwin CVS, WinCVS, etc)
    Just to get the source.  I use WinCVS from http://cvsgui.sf.net/

--------------
    Setup
--------------

1.  Get the win32 source from CVS.  At a minumim you'll need the
    following modules:
        win32/Common
        win32/Components
        win32/DAOCSkilla
    I put the source in an Excalibur directory.  Using Cygwin's command
    line CVS:
        mkdir Excalibur
        cd Excalibur
        cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/excalibar login
        (press enter when asked for a password)
        cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/excalibar co win32/Common
        cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/excalibar co win32/Components
        cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/excalibar co win32/DAOCSkilla

2.  Open DAOCSkilla.dpr from the File | Open Project... menu

3.  Run!

-------------
 Optionality
-------------
There are a couple options which can be turned off if they are causing
you troubles in building.  They can be accessed from Project |
Options... window, Directories/Conditionals tab, Conditional Defines
box.  When changing defines, you *MUST* do a "Build all" in order for
the changes to take effect throughout all the code.  These options are
not guaranteed to work if disabled, as they are never regression tested.

OPENGL_RENDERER: Enables the building of all OpenGL-based render
    dialog.  Remove the define to build without it.

DAOC_AUTO_SERVER: Enables the building of the Automation Object for
    TDaocControl.  Needed if you're going to use a macro script.
    Most functions have not been extended to the Automation interface.

REMOTE_ADMIN:  Enables a telnet server in DAOCSkilla that can be
    used to control it when Dark Age is running full screen.
