The program only reads to the end of the search string (0x0F through 0x87) so anything
after that can be thought of as a comment. Like this one.

If you got this file from cvs, it is set up for ToA. To make it work with SI,
the base address should be:

0x0042D03C

instead of:

0x0042E73B

Thats the second line of the file, by the way.

For 1.69 ToA (current Euro version as of the time of this writing, thanks to frits):
0x0040D0C1
