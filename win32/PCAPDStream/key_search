The program only reads to the end of the search string (0x0F through 0x87) so anything
after that can be thought of as a comment. Like this one.

If you got this file from cvs, it is set up for ToA. To make it work with SI,
the base address should be:

0x00421d0E

instead of:

0x0042E73B

Thats the second line of the file, by the way.
