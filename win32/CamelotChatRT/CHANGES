Teerex (03/Feb/2003)
--------------------
 + Version 0.4
 + Changed packet assembler to work off ACKs rather than taking data
 	 as available.  Might fix problems with stream losing sync.
 + Packet assembler will now force a resync if an expected packet
   is >4k (largest real packet I've ever seen is 1600 bytes).
 + Added Log to Screen option for those people who are cut-n-pasting
   it to another processor program.
 + Many enhancements to TDAOCConnection component.
