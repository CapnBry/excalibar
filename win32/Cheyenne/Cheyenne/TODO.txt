Cheyenne TODO list:

- Speed up text rendering

- Fix database issue when an infoid mapping is sometimes "lost". The total number of players should
*always* be the number of infoid mappings minus 1 (locally generated players will not have mappings).

- Test out sniffing multiple connections from the same instance of Cheyenne

- Fix health not always updated problem

- Fix "follow heading" display option

- Implement vector map loading
