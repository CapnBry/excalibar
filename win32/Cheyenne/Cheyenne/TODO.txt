Cheyenne TODO list:

- Fix database issue when an infoid mapping is sometimes "lost". The total number of players should
*always* be the number of infoid mappings minus 1 (locally generated players will not have mappings).

- Fix database issue where the "local" player is lost or reassigned a different ID. This is a 
very tough one :(

- Test out sniffing multiple connections from the same instance of Cheyenne

- Fix health not always updated problem

- Fix "follow heading" display option

- Fix z buffer issue where the png map textures overwrite the zone/vector map text

- Move png map load to a background thread like the vector map load. Texture generation must be done with an active
render context, so that will still have to be done in the GUI thread.

- Fix vector map loader: Tir Na Nog map file does not load, and the loader intentionally omits this one.

- Speed up text rendering

- Possibly optimize the new/delete memory allocation scheme for the fifos
