How to install and build Cheyenne:

1. What you will need

TO RUN IT:
- Some Win32 operating system. I use WinXP Pro, but Cheyenne has been seen to work on O/S's as old as NT4 SP6.
- A graphics card and driver that supports OpenGL as an ICD (installable client driver, most modern cards fit this bill just fine)
- WinPCAP 3.0 (later version should work with a recompile)
- GLUT (the OpenGL Utility Toolkit) for Win32

TO BUILD IT:
- All of the above plus:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 6
- Microfoft Visual Studio Service Pack 5
- June 2000 or later Microsoft Platform SDK (this may not be required, but I have it)
- WinPCAP 3.0 (or later) developer's pack. The header files and lib files for this are included with Cheyenne
- glpng v1.45 (or possibly later). 

2. What are these zip files for?

You should have received 5 zip files inside the main "redistributable" zip file:

	shared.zip
	Cheyenne.zip
	libnids-1.16a-win32.zip
	glpng.zip
	Cheyenne_exe.zip


- Shared.zip is a collection of things that were not necessarily created for Cheyenne's use. It contains header files and library files for the 
other zip files. You don't need it unless you want to build Cheyenne.

- Cheyenne.zip contains all the code for the Cheyenne executable. You don't need it unless you want to build Cheyenne.

- libnids-1.16a-win32.zip contains my version of libnids. You don't need it unless you want to build Cheyenne.

- glpng.zip contains the glpng library source code. You don't need it unless you want to build Cheyenne.

- Cheyenne_exe.zip is a one-stop-install for Cheyenne. Everything you need to run Cheyenne is in here. There are no zone png maps because they
are too big. Go to http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/excalibar and dig around for info on how to create the png files; they are very nice!

- A word about the Cheyenne_exe directory structure: the "main" cheyenne files (exe, cfg, mapinfo, and regionoffsets) live in the cheyenne_exe
directory. The actual maps (and .png if you got those some other way, I don't distribute them) live in the maps directory.

3. How do I run it?

- Install WinPCAP 3.0 and REBOOT (I had troubles if I didn't reboot after installation).

- UNzip the Cheyenne_exe.zip file and run Cheyenne.exe. I personally recommend running Cheyenne on a different computer than the one you
run DAoC on, but if you want to do it on the same machine, then you will want to up the priority of Cheyenne (System->Set Config).

- Mouse wheel and +/- zoom in and out. If an Actor is not being followed, the arrow keys pan the display.

4. How do I build it?

- Get and install all the prerequisites from section 1

- Plan your directory structure. Personally, I use:

\users\me\cheyenne <-- cheyenne zip file goes here
\users\me\shared <-- shared zip file goes here, but you will overwrite this after you build
\users\me\glpng <-- glpng zip file goes here
\users\me\libnids <-- libnids goes here
\users\me\Cheyenne_exe <-- you'll populate this directory after you build everything.

- Unzip everything into the directory you plan to use (see above ;)

- Build the support libraries (they all have DSP files with them):
	- glpng
	- libnids

- Copy the results (.lib files) of the support libraries into your "shared" directory. You should see the pattern as to where everything goes
if you peeked into the shared.zip file. This overwrites what came in the shared.zip file.

- Make sure the header files you used to build the support libraries are in your "shared" directory. This includes the WinPCAP developer headers as well as libnids headers. This is a pain, and one of these days I will automate it with a batch file or something.
This overwrites what came in the shared.zip file. Oh, and the WinPCAP headers should overwrite the libnids headers.

- Open the Cheyenne project.

- Add your shared\include directory to the C++ preprocessor options for additional include directories. For me, that's \users\me\shared.

- Add your shared\lib directory to the Linker input options for additional library path.

- Build Cheyenne.

- Copy the resultant exe from the debug (or release, if you built that version) directory to your Cheyenne_exe directory My dsp file will do this for me, but YMMV.

- You're done.
