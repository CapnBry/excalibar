Installation:
  glWindow.pas, glWindow.dcu, and glWindow.dcr must
  be copied to the Borland/Libs directory.

  Then start Delphi and click Component -> Install component
  and navigate to the Borland/Lib directory and select
  glWindow.pas and click Open then OK.

  This will install the component. You can access it under 
  the OpenGL tab.

Errors:
  If you notice any errors, problems, or quirks in the
  component please, please email me and let me know. I
  have only tested this on my computer and haven't tested
  every possible condition so it may not run on your computer.

  Component has only been tested under Delphi 5
