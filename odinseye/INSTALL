===============
READ THIS FIRST
===============

If you fail to follow these simple installation instructions
TO THE LETTER, and then come whining on the boards or channels, expect to
be publicly ridiculed.

===================
System Requirements
===================

These are the general system requirements for the machine running OE.
These requirements assume that the machine isn't doing anything else, if
it is, adjust as required.

- Pentium 233Mhz
- SVGA Graphics card with at least 512 KiB memory, supported by your
  Linux distribution.
- 64 MB Main Memory
- 256 MB Virtual Memory
- 750 MB free HD space (550 of which is for QT 3.0.1)

============================
Verifying your network setup
============================

You need to set up a sniffing environment. How to do that is
beyond the scope of this simple INSTALL file, but look around the
net; there are many guides.
To verify that your sniffing setup is correct, run the following command
on your would-be OE box WHILE playing DAOC:

tcpdump -n host <IP of your Windows Machine playing DAOC>

You should (hopefully) see two-way traffic, that is traffic both to AND
from your windows machine. If you don't, you don't have a sniffing
setup, and you should fix that first.

===============================
Checking your UNIX distribution
===============================

You absolutely, 100% sure, without a doubt need:
- A recent version of X11
- A somewhat recent C++ compiler
- An OpenGL impementation. Mesa will do fine.
- Libpcap. A version recent enough that it handles the cooked-mode "any" device.
- QT X11 Free version 3.0.1

My personal build platform is RH 7.2
If you installed RH 7.2 with "everything", the only thing you need to
update is QT 3.0.1 (instructions below).
If you don't have RH 7.2 or didn't install with "everything", you're on
your own. If it doesn't work for you AND you manage to fix it, send me a
patch. If it doesn't work for you and you can't fix it; BE QUIET and
wait for someone else to fix it.

================
Become superuser
================

If you're not already root, type "su" and fill in the superuser password
at the prompt.

===================
Installing QT 3.0.1
===================

Please follow these steps to the letter. If you don't, and it doesn't work,
don't clutter the message boards or the developer's mailboxes with messages.

1) Remove any vendor-supplied version of QT3
   For RedHat this is:
     rpm -e $(rpm -qa | grep -i qt3)
     cd /usr/lib
     rm -rf qt-3.0.0

2) cd /usr/lib/
3) ncftpget ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-x11-free-3.0.1.tar.gz
4) tar xvvfz qt-x11-free-3.0.1.tar.gz
5) mv qt-x11-free-3.0.1 qt-3.0.1
6) rm qt-x11-free-3.0.1.tar.gz
7) cd qt-3.0.1
8) export QTDIR=$(pwd)
9) ./configure -thread
10) make

Make will take several hours. It's supposed to, so don't panic.

====================================
Downloading and compiling Odin's Eye
====================================

1) cd ~
2) mkdir odinseye
3) cd odinseye
4) lynx -source http://www.hackersquest.org/daoc/src/odinseye-latest.tar.gz | tar xvvfz -
5) export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-3.0.1
6) /usr/lib/qt-3.0.1/bin/qmake odinseye.pro
7) make

==============================
Getting the DAOC Crypt library
==============================

1) cd ~/odinseye
2) lynx -source http://www.hackersquest.org/daoc/daoccrypt.tar.gz | tar xvvfz -

==================
Running Odin's Eye
==================

1) cd ~/odinseye
2) ifconfig eth0 promisc     # Replace eth0 with whatever card you normally use
3) ulimit -c unlimited
4) ./odinseye --update

The program will display a few lines, but nothing else will happen.
==> This is as it should be. <==

Go to your windows machine and log on DAOC. You must not start the DAOC
Client before OE is running, or you will get nothing.

The first time the window opens, you probably want to go to the "Settings"
menu and click on "Reload Maplist" to make sure your newly downloaded maps
are used.

==================
Running the Editor
==================

The editor is a standalone Java program. You need at least JDK 1.3
to run it, but 1.4 or better is encouraged.

To see your java version, type:

java -version

To run the editor, make sure you have java installed (http://java.sun.com)
and type:

java -jar editor.java


To get the editor to link to OE, you need to start OE like this:

./odinseye --link

When you connect to DAOC, the port number the editor needs will be show in
the window title of OE.
