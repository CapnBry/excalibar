Odin's Eye

This program is copyright 2001 Slicer/Hackersquest
<slicer@hackersquest.org> and is released under the GNU Public
License. See the file COPYING for details.

Please note that this program requires the daoccrypt library which is not
included with the program.

The maps will be autodownloaded the first time you run OE with the
--update parameter. The maps were contributed through Mapfiend (he has a
readme file in maps/Maps_Readme.txt) and downloaded from hackersquest.org

OE will store edited maps in the usermaps/ directory, and any maps stored
in this directory will override the default downloaded ones.

To contact the author, please write to slicer@ethernalquest.org,
or preferably use the "Odin's Eye" forum at
http://www.hackersquest.org/boards/

There's a small group of likeminded people hanging out in #odinseye on
irc.trifocus.net if you're more into internet relayed chatting.

Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions. No support
will be given to people who do not follow the INSTALL instructions
to the letter.
