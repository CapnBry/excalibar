	* Removed black line artifacts in textured mode
	* Software mode always uses just GL_NEAREST, slight
	  performance increase at cost of quality
	* Editor requires JDK 1.4
	* Bug in convall.sh .. .pnm->.png
2002-01-17 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Off-by-one bug in WinIni in the converter
	* Converter uses textures for water/lava
	* Realm recognition of players taken from packets
	  Offset found by Entity and Koronis
2002-01-16 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Updated converter to darken maps
	* Fixed map loading of negative-coordinate maps (oops)
	* Updated oeItem and oeConnection to match new 18 byte
	  item structures
2002-01-15 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Builtin editor removed
	* Spawn functions for the java editor
	* Textured background maps
	* convert.jar, which includes a basic map converter
2002-01-09 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Lots of changes and I haven't documented as I did them :(
	* New editor -- Standalone Java package in editor.jar
	* oeLink class added, to export location to the editor
	* Zlib compression of map transfers
2002-01-03 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Some tesselation GLU version dependencies
	* usermaps/ directory, based off patch from SnowBlind
	* Fixed multiple instance timer problem
2001-12-31 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Tesselation combine callback -- selfintersecting lines
	  can now be filled, even if it's technically wrong to
	  allow it.
	* Updated FAQ to reflect that the Mesa in RH 7.2 and quite
	  a few other distributions does NOT support the tesselation
	  combine callback.
2001-12-30 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* More map speedups, now caching GL drawing in display lists
	  again, and updating display lists as needed.
	* Filled polygon support
2001-12-28 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Add some extra #includes to oeSniffer.cpp
	* Mob timeout is dependant on whether it's moving or not
	* Map drawing optimizations
	* Implemented a Douglas Peucker line simplifier which can be
	  autorun upon map loading -- should reduce map drawing time
	* Corrected Blue/Green color typo.
2001-12-27 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Compensating for maps saved with buggy Qt 3.0.0
	* Keyboard map navigation
	* Fixed a few glaring bugs in the mapeditor
2001-12-25 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Map Editor added
	  Suggested over and over and over by Sparr ;)
2001-12-23 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Map fading is an option
	* Most used actions now have a keyboard accel
2001-12-22 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Map fading. Items at other depths than you will
	  fade away.
	  Suggested quite a few times by Sparr.
2001-12-20 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Uploading of items completed
	* Recording of information fixed
2001-12-19 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Using the designer puts the images back in the .pro file
	  Removed them again.
	* oeItem added - start of an item database
2001-12-18 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* A few bugfixes
2001-12-17 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* oePrefs added, shared between windows. Moved all preferences code
	  to this class.
	* Spawn list colors are selectable.
2001-12-16 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Sort by distance option, also new option of when to resort the
	  spawn list - Changing this from "Never" requires major
	  processing power
	* Removed the automatic bpf-filter code. Seems that during
	  pcap_setfilter() packets aren't sniffed at all.
	* GL Projection changes. Not sure if it's for the better yet ;)
	* Clicking the map now uses gluUnProject(), so it works no matter
	  how the map is rotated or zoomed :)
	* Fixed some typos
	* Changed all player highlight colors around
	* Made invading players flash in the map
2001-12-15 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Added the drawing of rulers to aid navigation
	* Added option to rotate display so 'Up' on the map is whats 'ahead'
	  in the game.
	  Suggested by Sparr
	* Expanded the object sizes to three choices.
	* Made capture files include timestamp of packets, and playback
	  is now at normal speed.
	* If map information is available, all coordinates are remapped
	  to match the cooked ingame coordinates.
	* Began updates to the mob-is-stale detection.
	  Rest will wait until speed is decoded and implemented
2001-12-14 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Added oeHttpCopyFile -- QUrlOperator::copy() seems broken
	* Added the --realtime option. The new default is to 
	  not use realtime sniffing, just high priority one.
	  Apparantly this is better than realtime in some cases.
	  Thanks to Xy for finding this fact.
	* Added the player name to the caption of the window
	  Suggested by Jerry.
2001-12-13 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Gearing up for BETA release
	* Updated README and INSTALL
2001-12-09 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
