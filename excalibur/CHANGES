Druppy (16/Feb/02)
-----------------
Changes:
	+ Added a message view window

Andon (16/Feb/02)
-----------------

Changes:
 + Optimized exPacket slightly.. Nothing major, but this
   is the beginning of a long series of optimizations I
   am planning
 + Tweaked the stale timer a bit more.. Again, nothing
   really major, just some minor tweaks here and there.
 + Made some changes to the CHANGES file itself..  We
   still don't seem to have come to a single universal
   format <grins>


Druppy (14/Feb/02)
-----------------

Changes:
  + Made the mob filter a member of the connection class
    so each window can have different filters.

Changes (teerex):
  + Reduced vertex count on MOB / player objects.  Changed
    shading model to flat.
  + Range circles now use GLfloats.


Teerex (13/Feb/02)
-----------------

Additions:
 + Decreased vertex count on pyramid object.

Additions (Andon):
 + Optimized some of the code in exPacket.. Providing some
   preliminary support for non-32-bit platforms.

 Bug fixes:
 + Fixed a bug where range circles were missing their last
   segment, at least on my machine.
 + Fixed normals on pyramid object for better lighing.


Andon (12/Feb/02)
-----------------

Additions:
 + Added NEW objects for the object spawn type on the map..
   It's a Pyramid or square, depending on your map seetings.

Additions (teerex):
 + Added support for 0x05 TCP/UDP packet (self health update).

Bug Fixes:
 + Fixed a bug that was causing object spawns to be marked
   as "stale" due to the fact that no position updates were
   being received for them.
 + Fixed a Signal 11 (SIGSEGV - Segmentation Fault) caused
   by assuming ds was always initialized.. A recent patch
   has caused us to have to re-evaluate those criteria.
   
Bug Fixes (teerex):
 + Removed double coding for stale check and moved to checkStale().
   Decreased the stale range to 10,000 for all mobs/players/items.
 + Fixed major bug in experimental code for mob loc projection that
   was ganking things out of the list.


SnowBlind (11/Feb/02)
---------------------

Additions:
	+ Added Sticky mob list option in misc prefs tab
	  (this option tries to keep the selected mob
	  visible)


Druppy (11/Feb/02)
------------------
Additions:
	+ Added a RegExp Filter at the top of the map


Druppy (10/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
	+ Added Distance Field in the Mob List
	+ Added an option to enable Color-Coding
	  spawns based on thier con in the mob list.
	  This feature is toggable via 
	  Prefs->Misc->EnableMobListColors


Andon (10/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions (SnowBlind):
 + Added a command line option to turn on packet captures
   not defaults to not making one if you dont add the
   --capture option

Additions:
 + Added support for object spawns..  These include things
   such as:  Graves, Realm Banners, and other misc. spawns.

   * I will give object spawns their own size / shape and
     color in a future patch..

 + Added support to compile Excalibur 1.0.7 in FreeBSD!!
    (Thank you Ackmed)

   * The code assumes you want to sniff on fxp0, if you want
     to use another interface, edit excalibur.h - I'll add
     support to change this at runtime when I get some more
     free time

Additions (SnowBlind):
 + Added a way to turn off drawing of each range circle PLEASE
   CLICK DOWN DOWN BUTTON UNTILL IT SAYS 'No Draw' IF YOU DONT
   WANT THEM TO DRAW
 + Changed the steping of the range circle to 25
 
Bug fixes:
 + Fixed a SERIOUS stack corruption issue with the dump unknown
   data code..  Using printf on a plain string is BAD BAD BAD,
   Any packet containing a %* in it could cause a stack corrup-
   tion. It's been fixed, and there's no longer a security risk
   associated with that code.


Andon (09/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Added the ability to toggle a few DEBUG features on or off
   at runtime... They are:
     - Log unknown packets to stdout
     - Log unknown packets to a file
     - Enable experimental code
     - Show out of order packets

    * More to come later

Additions (SnowBlind):
 + Added a new prefs tab for Map Circles to allow runtime changing.
   of circles radius (support for user entered numbers comming soon)
 + Moved the Map Circles draw options from the Map Display to the
   new prefs tab.

   * More to come later (maybe line thickness, and color)


Andon (08/Feb/02)
------------------

Bug fixes (Me):
 + CapnBry's mob delta position prediction has been disabled
   by default now.. For testing purposes, it can still be
   enabled by removing the #undef ALPHA_QUALITY in excalibur.h

Additions (Snowblind):
 + Enhanced the status bar.. Displays zone name now

Additions (Snowblind):
 + Enhanced the status bar.. It's MUCH nicer now than it was.

Additions (CapnBry):
 + Added range circles to the map
 + Added --dumpunknown to the command line switches
 + Added projection of mob / player positions to aproximate current location
   based on heading and speed.
 + Added support for "Stop mob movement" stream.

Additions (Me):
 + Added a '--help' command line switch.
 + Added a GUI element in the preferences to toggle range
   circles on and off at run-time.
 + Added distance fading agro circles.. The intensity of the
   R channel in the RGB color now changes depending upon your
   distance from the mob.
 + Added a GUI element in the preferences to toggle agro
   distance fading.

Bug fixes (CapnBry):
 + Changed the range circles to be dark grey, so that they
   actually show up now.

Bug fixes (Me):
 + Added an experimental fix for the QT_NETWORK_MODULE issues
   experienced at compile time. The method I used for this is
   questionable at best.


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Documentation:
 + Fixed a lingering issue with the CVS commandline listed in
   INSTALL


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Added preliminary support for NVidia GLX specific optimizations
   (expect to see this support utilized in the near future!)
 + As a result of the abovementioned addition, Excalibur now uses
   a different method for detecting DRI support on your machine,
   the new method is much more intelligent and verbose.

Documentation:
 + Fixed a few issues where some portions of the Excalibur docs
   were violating the GPL..
 + Fixed a few typos made in the INSTALL docs.
 + Fixed a few invalid claims made in README and INSTALL.
 + Added minimal info for installing Excalibur on Debian UNSTABLE.


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Removed the lame X/Y/Z / Zone indicator above the spawn
   list, it's been moved to the status bar now!
 + Added a Zone ID --> Zone Name feature, see the status bar
   for an example.

Bug Fixes:
 + Applied CapnBry's patch to fix some map "issues" in Albion.


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Added CapnBry's patch for mob agro indicators..
 + Added to his patch, providing a GUI element to toggle them
   on and off at run-time.


Andon (06/Feb/02)

 BIG NEWS
----------
 + Odin's Eye has been merged into a new Open Source project..

 ** Excalibur is born! **

 Excalibur follows a much different plan of attack than Odin's Eye did.

 Excalibur is designed to be completely Open Source.. We encourage the
 modification of code, and through Source Forge we provide you with a
 powerful tool for doing so.. Anyone is welcome to join the project as
 a developer, just contact myself or one of the other project admins on
 Source Forge.
