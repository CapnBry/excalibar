Teerex (03/Jun/02)
------------------
Changes:
 + Added rotate property for zones, since some were upside-
   down.  I've only rotated one zone right now, but will rotate
   others as I find them.
 + Made the max mob stale distance dynamic based on when the
   server sends us the mob loc.

Teerex (01/Jun/02)
------------------
Changes:
 + Fixed triange borders for realm color not displaying
   due to being culled.
 + Fixed fast aggro indicators not displaying at all.
 + Fixed quality aggro indicators overwriting triangle.
 + Fixed distance fade on aggro indicators.
 + Fixed vector map elements not recaching when needed.
 + Fixed some filled vector map areas not filling due
   to culling.
 + Removed erronious double-drawing of map elements.
   Should be a drastic speed improvement, since even
   the PNG textures were being drawn twice!
 + Fixed vector maps not displaying unless "Fill map
   polygons" and "Depthfade" were both on.
 + Shrunk size of status bar and layout grid to provide
   a few more pixels of map.
 + Added MaxFPS preference to run the draw loop at idle.
   This will show you your maximum FPS at the cost of
   sucking up all your available CPU time.
 + Renamed Use Use Texture Filtering to Use Linear filtering,
   since it just swaps between NEAREST and LINEAR min and mag
   algorithms.
Notes:
 + Turning on "Fill map polygons" causes a large performance
   hit.

Teerex (31/May/02)-2
------------------
Changes:
 + Fixed agro circles always being yellow.
 + Rewound PNG texture quad to be front-facing.
 + Enabled backface culling to halve polygon count

Teerex (31/May/02)
------------------
Changes:
 + Added Mandrake section to INSTALL doc.
 + Optimized map paint to not draw objects not inside 
   the viewport.
 + Removed "Item" page from preferences, "Upload Items" 
   from main menu.  Item upload no longer supported.
 + Tiny paint optimization to those not rasterizing 
   player names, and/or drawing player/merchant names.

Teerex (26/May/02)
------------------
Changes (not actually today, just catching up):
 + Changed exMob speed to signed int.
 + Players now move smoothly using projected position.
 + Changed DRI messages to be more informational and
   less silly.
 + Changed pcap sniffer timeout to 200ms, select() 
   timeout to 200ms to decrease latency between 
   processing.
 + Upped version to 1.2.3

Teerex (04/May/02)
------------------
Changes:
 + Removed dependancy on exCrypt library.  Decryption
   is now handled by the exPacket class.

Teerex (10/Apr/02)
------------------
Changes:
 + Fixed syntax error before '&' in exConnection.h 
   and exMob.h using gcc3.
 + Fixed namespace collision in exMap.cpp causing
   "prototype does not match any in class" error
   in gcc3
 + Decreased stale range to 7500, since we don't
   get any updates past this point.
 + Added projected player position to move player
   smoothly across map rather than updating every
   second.
 + Added console line describing connection on new 
   connect.
 + Changed FPS calculation.  Now shows actual FPS
   rather than a theorectical maximum FPS it was
   before.  Not finished with this yet, will re-
   introduce the max FPS.

Teerex (07/Apr/02)
------------------
Changes:
 + Fixed mob list occasionally getting sorted
   erratically when new items are added

Andon (08/Mar/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + New x86 encryption library revision, it is
   STRONGLY suggested that you download it!!!

 * Version bumped to 1.2.2c


Andon (07/Mar/02)
-----------------
Bug Fixes:
 + Vector maps work again

 * Version bumped to 1.2.2b


Andon (07/Mar/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + The Map Loader progress indicator has been
   moved to the status bar to conserve valued
   window space...

Bug Fixes:
 + Several SEGV potentials have been fixed...
 + Thread safety has been improved slightly.
 + Some legacy code has been removed.


NOTES:
       The 1.2 series will be wrapping up soon
       to make way for 1.3.0! 1.3.0 is going
       to add SEVERAL new map features. The
       more notable features include:

        + FULL 3D Terrain Mapping
        + FULL S3 Texture Compression support
        + The ability to capture map screen-
          shots to .tga files
        + Group mate player circles
        + Experience packet decoding


 * Version bumped to 1.2.2a


Andon (03/Mar/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + The zoom slider now has a MUCH larger range.

Additions:
 + OpenGL API Call Debugging is now in the exp-
   erimental code section of the preferences...
   If you notice something strange going on at
   render-time, turn this on and send any stderr
   output to us on the forums.
 + Ghetto Aspect Ratio Maintenence (TM) has been
   added.. It's not the prettiest method for
   doing this, but it works (sort of). I'll put
   more time into it in the future.

Bug Fixes:
 + Fixed more OpenGL matrix stack buffer issues
   both underflows and overflows. Thanks to the
   new OpenGL API Call Debugging I added :)

 * Version bumped to 1.2.2


Andon (03/Mar/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + Map elements that fail to pass the sanity
   checks are now printed to stderr with USEFUL
   info!
 + All vector map elements have been given a
  "safety boost" of 10 meters.. This ought to
   fix all issues where elements with a Z co-
   ord close to 0 would intersect with the XY
   plane when zoomed to an unusal ratio.

Additions:
 + Added SEVERAL new vector maps, derived from
   my experimental vector map auto-gen.. The
   auto-gen for vector maps is similar to the
   PNG auto-gen, but it's written in PERL and
   it's a lot faster :)
 + Added bounds info to ALL Hibernian zones,
   Midgard and Albion are on the way.. So be
   patient :)

Documentation:
 + Changed the compiler requirements in INSTALL
   to gcc 3.0+
 + Changed the OS requirements to reflect all
   known workable UNIX distributions.
 + Added a section to the FAQ relating to WHY
   you NEED gcc 3.0 for the new exCrypt lib...

 * Version bumped to 1.2.1a


Andon (02/Mar/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + In order to begin adding support for non-x86
   architectures, daoccrypt has been re-written
   and re-named..  exCrypt.so now.

  * NOTE: This means to run Excalibur now, you
          MUST read the INSTALL file again and
          follow the new procedures at compile
          time.

 * Version bumped to 1.2.1


Andon (28/Feb/02)
-----------------
Major Changes:
==============
 + Optimized the hell out of the OpenGL rendering
   algorithms. I'm NOT exagerating when I say you
   can expect a good 2 - 3x performance gain with
   1.2.0 !!!

 + Changed depth fading to use a higher quality
   and quicker alpha blending routine.

 + Changed the default size of objects when you
   start Excalibur..


Major Additions:
================
 + 2 - 3x the framerate (this isn't really an add-
   ition, I just like mentioning it :))

 + Up to 1/2 the memory requirements for PNG maps.
   I will be fooling around with the OpenGL exten-
   sion for S3TC (S3 Texture Compression) soon, so
   these numbers may become even more attractive.

 + Added a new FPS meter to the status bar.. It's
   an average of calculated FPS for all frames in
   the past 1 second. Therefore, this number will
   NOT change unless something on the map moves,
   or you resize the window. This is ALSO why the
   FPS meter reads "???" when you initially start
   Excalibur.


Bug Fixes:
 + The option to toggle "Simple Objects" has been
   restored.. Sorry about that, my bad?

 + The mob list doesn't resort itself every time
   a player moves anymore. It was NEVER intended
   to function that way.

 + Issues where the map rulers' color attributes
   were being corrupted at render time have been
   addressed. (I think anyway, this may require
   more debugging to completely fix).

 + Several SEGV / Uncontrolable thread issues in
   the PNG loader have been corrected. The newer
   Mutex / Semaphore system should ultimately be
   more stable and quicker than it was in 1.1.x.

 + Fixed a few memory leaks in:
  - The Excalibur GUI
  - The Map Loader Engine
  - The Excalibur Map
  - Druppy's Message Parser

  NOTE: Just as the 1.1.x series added the new
        Map Loader engine, 1.2.0 has several new
        planned features. Almost all of them are
        map related.. Most notable, S3TC for HW
        accelerated OpenGL (NVidia / DRI), this
        will decrease the memory needed for PNG
        maps considerably, with a small loss of
        image quality (it'll be optional though)

  * Version bumped to 1.2.0


Andon (26/Feb/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + Druppy's message parsing code has been disabled
   by default now, due to it's insane memory leaks.
   If you understand the risks but still insist on
   using it, add the command line switch:

     --druppy-leak

Bug Fixes:
 + Agro and Filtered circles are now being lit and
   faded the same way they were pre-1.1.2.
 + Camelot Hills is now being detected by the adjac-
   ent zone detection algorithm.. It snuck through
   the cracks since the algorithm assumed the zone
   numbers were all non-zero.

  * Version bumped to 1.1.3c


Andon (25/Feb/02)
-----------------
Additions:
 + Added rasterization of player names as an option..
 + Added rasterization of merchant types as an option
   (Defaults to ON now)

  * Hotkeys are:  N / M respectively.  They may also
    be permanently set or unset in the preferences. 

Changes:
 + The render process has been tweaked a bit more..
   Reduced the number of times per frame that Excalibur
   has to Backup / Restore rendering settings.
 + The preferences dialog has been tweaked to accomidate
   a much wider spectrum of resolutions.
 + Added preliminary support for a HUGE array of new
   packet OpCodes recently discovered.. Though their
   structures are still unknown, they won't be listed
   under unknown packets anymore.

Bug Fixes:
 + The player triangle is now depth buffered using a 
   "normal" algorithm.. That is, it won't CONSTANTLY be
   on top of everything else.
 + Fixed a few memory leaks in Druppy's exMessage class.
 + A few issues have been addressed where surface attr-
   ibutes were incorrectly being reset during rendering.

  * Version bumped to 1.1.3b


Andon (24/Feb/02)
-----------------
Additions:
 + Added support for Mip Mapping on NVidia cards...
   This can be enabled / disabled in the preferences.
 + Added support for linear texture filtering on NVidia
   cards. This can also be enabled / disabled.

Changes:
 + Alpha blended circles now work without depth fading
   enabled.
 + Changed the map rendering order around a bit.. To
   make sure that the player arrow is always rendered
   and that all range circles correctly alpha blend.

Bug Fixes:
 + Fixed a bug where the rotation of the map was offset
   by +1 degree (counter clockwise).

 * Version bumped to 1.1.3a

 NOTE: Mip Mapping will significantly increase the mem-
       ory requirements of Excalibur.. It's probably
       not a good idea to enable this in combination
       with Adjacent Zone loading.


Andon (23/Feb/02)
-----------------
Major Changes:
==============
 + The PNG Loader has been renamed MapLoader.. It will now
   work for BOTH PNG and Vector maps.
 + Vector Maps are now overlayed on top of PNG maps again.
 + Vector Maps can now be loaded using the adjacent zone
   algorithms.
 + PNG Maps may now be toggled on / off at runtime

Major Additions:
================
 + Alpha blended surfaces for filter / agro circles now.
   There are two optimization methods to choose from:
  - Speed Optimized   (Lower Quality, but FAST)
  - Quality Optimized (High Quality, but SLOW)
 + Alpha blended surfaces may now overlap without freaky
   things going on.
 + The new alpha blended circles have a toggle for border.
   These are red / yellow circles encompasing the surface.
 + A new map menu:
  - Manual recache (DEBUG)
  - Manual on-the-fly map reloading
  - Toggle PNG Maps        (Requires a Map Reload)
  - Toggle Adjacent Zones  (Requires a Map Reload)
  - Toggle alpha blended range circles

 NOTE: Alpha blending requires map depth filtering to be
       enabled manually to work right.. I'll fix that in
       1.1.3a

 * Version bumped to 1.1.3


Andon (22/Feb/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + When loading adjacent zones, the zone you're currently
   in is given priority in the sorting algorithm..It will
   now load before all others.
 + The PNG Loader's progress dialog now pops up with 0%
   the very second it begins reading the .PNG file.. This
   is intentional, since reading the file can take a good
   deal of time on slower storage mediums.
 + Added better thread dequeing mechanisms.. Zoning while
   the PNG Loader is already loading maps is handled much
   more efficiently now.

 + Version bumped to 1.1.2b


Druppy (22/Feb/02)
-----------------
Changes:
	+ Added regexp filter circles around filted mobs.

Andon (21/Feb/02)
-----------------
Changes:
 + Added some more verbosity to the PNG Loader's status
   dialog.
 + Eliminated the need to call sleep continuously in
   the PNG Loader progress dalog.
 + Optimized the PNG Loader's primary PNG --> BMP algor-
   ithms.
 + Added stricter pointer verification for inter-thread
   communication between the various threads in the PNG
   Loader.
 + Pressing the cancel button while the PNG Loader is
   running will now IMMEDIATELY halt the thread.
 + Zone specific "rotation" has been completely removed.
   This never should have been in Odin's Eye to begin
   with, its TRUE value is actually zone type.

Bug Fixes:
 + Fixed some lingering issues with thread state checking.
 + Added the progress dialog's sleep timer back... Turns
   out we still need it after all :)

 + Version bumped to 1.1.2a


Andon (20/Feb/02)
-----------------
Major Changes:
==============
 + The new PNG loading engine has been reworked a LOT...
   The changes allow the following:
    - Multiple maps may now be loaded at once.
    - New algorithms to detect adjacent zones.
    - Enhanced mapinfo.txt parsing
    - The ability to cancel map loading
    - Some added thread safety.

   * I will be adding a new map menu soon where you will
     be able to turn this feature on and off on the fly,
     as well as completely flush the textures on the map
     and some other things..

 + Also changed the user triangle to yellow (so you can
   see it easier).  This change may be quite undesirable.
   So let me know if you hate it.

 + Updated mapinfo.txt - Generated by a new program I
   wrote to parse the client files.. This new offset
   data is 100% accurate!  I'll release the program that
   parses the client files soon..

 + Version bumped up to 1.1.2

 PLEASE NOTE: The new adjacent map code is disabled by
              default, because it requires a great deal
              of CPU time / memory resources..  To use
              it, enable it in the preferences dialog.

              Also, there may be a small noticable delay
              between initial PNG loads now..  The code
              has to sift through the adjacent zones
              before it loads any of the PNGs. It's not
              seriously slow, but I do know about this
              and I am working on ways to work around
              it.


Andon (18/Feb/02)
-----------------
Major Changes:
==============
 + PNG maps are now loaded in their own threads!
 + The new PNG loading engine adds a progress dialog while
   loading the PNGs!

  * I'm planning on finishing the PNG loading engine by adding
    a handler for the ABORT callback, be happy with what you
    have right now though.

 + Version number bumped up to 1.1.1 for obvious reasons.

ENJOY!


Druppy (18/Feb/02)
-----------------
Changes:
	+ Added a Vader warning that will beep() when non-mob 
	  non-friendly person is drawn into the spawn list. 
	  Settings->vaderWarn or Ctrl+w

Druppy (17/Feb/02)
-----------------
Changes:
	+ Added resizeable feature to chat group 
	  window and a PML(Probable Magic Loot)
	  and Chat Group Tab

-----------------

Changes
 + Increased the version number to 1.1.0 !!

-----------------
Changes:
  + Added a message view window
  + Added Group Items pref to grout items at the bottom o
    of the mob list

Andon (16/Feb/02)
-----------------

Changes:
 + Optimized exPacket slightly.. Nothing major, but this
   is the beginning of a long series of optimizations I
   am planning
 + Tweaked the stale timer a bit more.. Again, nothing
   really major, just some minor tweaks here and there.
 + Made some changes to the CHANGES file itself..  We
   still don't seem to have come to a single universal
   format <grins>


Druppy (14/Feb/02)
-----------------

Changes:
  + Made the mob filter a member of the connection class
    so each window can have different filters.

Changes (teerex):
  + Reduced vertex count on MOB / player objects.  Changed
    shading model to flat.
  + Range circles now use GLfloats.


Teerex (13/Feb/02)
-----------------

Additions:
 + Decreased vertex count on pyramid object.

Additions (Andon):
 + Optimized some of the code in exPacket.. Providing some
   preliminary support for non-32-bit platforms.

 Bug fixes:
 + Fixed a bug where range circles were missing their last
   segment, at least on my machine.
 + Fixed normals on pyramid object for better lighing.


Andon (12/Feb/02)
-----------------

Additions:
 + Added NEW objects for the object spawn type on the map..
   It's a Pyramid or square, depending on your map seetings.

Additions (teerex):
 + Added support for 0x05 TCP/UDP packet (self health update).

Bug Fixes:
 + Fixed a bug that was causing object spawns to be marked
   as "stale" due to the fact that no position updates were
   being received for them.
 + Fixed a Signal 11 (SIGSEGV - Segmentation Fault) caused
   by assuming ds was always initialized.. A recent patch
   has caused us to have to re-evaluate those criteria.
   
Bug Fixes (teerex):
 + Removed double coding for stale check and moved to checkStale().
   Decreased the stale range to 10,000 for all mobs/players/items.
 + Fixed major bug in experimental code for mob loc projection that
   was ganking things out of the list.


SnowBlind (11/Feb/02)
---------------------

Additions:
	+ Added Sticky mob list option in misc prefs tab
	  (this option tries to keep the selected mob
	  visible)


Druppy (11/Feb/02)
------------------
Additions:
	+ Added a RegExp Filter at the top of the map


Druppy (10/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
	+ Added Distance Field in the Mob List
	+ Added an option to enable Color-Coding
	  spawns based on thier con in the mob list.
	  This feature is toggable via 
	  Prefs->Misc->EnableMobListColors


Andon (10/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions (SnowBlind):
 + Added a command line option to turn on packet captures
   not defaults to not making one if you dont add the
   --capture option

Additions:
 + Added support for object spawns..  These include things
   such as:  Graves, Realm Banners, and other misc. spawns.

   * I will give object spawns their own size / shape and
     color in a future patch..

 + Added support to compile Excalibur 1.0.7 in FreeBSD!!
    (Thank you Ackmed)

   * The code assumes you want to sniff on fxp0, if you want
     to use another interface, edit excalibur.h - I'll add
     support to change this at runtime when I get some more
     free time

Additions (SnowBlind):
 + Added a way to turn off drawing of each range circle PLEASE
   CLICK DOWN DOWN BUTTON UNTILL IT SAYS 'No Draw' IF YOU DONT
   WANT THEM TO DRAW
 + Changed the steping of the range circle to 25
 
Bug fixes:
 + Fixed a SERIOUS stack corruption issue with the dump unknown
   data code..  Using printf on a plain string is BAD BAD BAD,
   Any packet containing a %* in it could cause a stack corrup-
   tion. It's been fixed, and there's no longer a security risk
   associated with that code.


Andon (09/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Added the ability to toggle a few DEBUG features on or off
   at runtime... They are:
     - Log unknown packets to stdout
     - Log unknown packets to a file
     - Enable experimental code
     - Show out of order packets

    * More to come later

Additions (SnowBlind):
 + Added a new prefs tab for Map Circles to allow runtime changing.
   of circles radius (support for user entered numbers comming soon)
 + Moved the Map Circles draw options from the Map Display to the
   new prefs tab.

   * More to come later (maybe line thickness, and color)


Andon (08/Feb/02)
------------------

Bug fixes (Me):
 + CapnBry's mob delta position prediction has been disabled
   by default now.. For testing purposes, it can still be
   enabled by removing the #undef ALPHA_QUALITY in excalibur.h

Additions (Snowblind):
 + Enhanced the status bar.. Displays zone name now

Additions (Snowblind):
 + Enhanced the status bar.. It's MUCH nicer now than it was.

Additions (CapnBry):
 + Added range circles to the map
 + Added --dumpunknown to the command line switches
 + Added projection of mob / player positions to aproximate current location
   based on heading and speed.
 + Added support for "Stop mob movement" stream.

Additions (Me):
 + Added a '--help' command line switch.
 + Added a GUI element in the preferences to toggle range
   circles on and off at run-time.
 + Added distance fading agro circles.. The intensity of the
   R channel in the RGB color now changes depending upon your
   distance from the mob.
 + Added a GUI element in the preferences to toggle agro
   distance fading.

Bug fixes (CapnBry):
 + Changed the range circles to be dark grey, so that they
   actually show up now.

Bug fixes (Me):
 + Added an experimental fix for the QT_NETWORK_MODULE issues
   experienced at compile time. The method I used for this is
   questionable at best.


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Documentation:
 + Fixed a lingering issue with the CVS commandline listed in
   INSTALL


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Added preliminary support for NVidia GLX specific optimizations
   (expect to see this support utilized in the near future!)
 + As a result of the abovementioned addition, Excalibur now uses
   a different method for detecting DRI support on your machine,
   the new method is much more intelligent and verbose.

Documentation:
 + Fixed a few issues where some portions of the Excalibur docs
   were violating the GPL..
 + Fixed a few typos made in the INSTALL docs.
 + Fixed a few invalid claims made in README and INSTALL.
 + Added minimal info for installing Excalibur on Debian UNSTABLE.


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Removed the lame X/Y/Z / Zone indicator above the spawn
   list, it's been moved to the status bar now!
 + Added a Zone ID --> Zone Name feature, see the status bar
   for an example.

Bug Fixes:
 + Applied CapnBry's patch to fix some map "issues" in Albion.


Andon (07/Feb/02)
------------------

Additions:
 + Added CapnBry's patch for mob agro indicators..
 + Added to his patch, providing a GUI element to toggle them
   on and off at run-time.


Andon (06/Feb/02)
------------------
 BIG NEWS
----------
 + Odin's Eye has been merged into a new Open Source project..

 ** Excalibur is born! **

 Excalibur follows a much different plan of attack than Odin's Eye did.

 Excalibur is designed to be completely Open Source.. We encourage the
 modification of code, and through Source Forge we provide you with a
 powerful tool for doing so.. Anyone is welcome to join the project as
 a developer, just contact myself or one of the other project admins on
 Source Forge.

2001-12-25 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Map Editor added
	  Suggested over and over and over by Sparr ;)
2001-12-23 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Map fading is an option
	* Most used actions now have a keyboard accel
2001-12-22 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Map fading. Items at other depths than you will
	  fade away.
	  Suggested quite a few times by Sparr.
2001-12-20 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Uploading of items completed
	* Recording of information fixed
2001-12-19 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Using the designer puts the images back in the .pro file
	  Removed them again.
	* oeItem added - start of an item database
2001-12-18 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* A few bugfixes
2001-12-17 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* oePrefs added, shared between windows. Moved all preferences code
	  to this class.
	* Spawn list colors are selectable.
2001-12-16 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Sort by distance option, also new option of when to resort the
	  spawn list - Changing this from "Never" requires major
	  processing power
	* Removed the automatic bpf-filter code. Seems that during
	  pcap_setfilter() packets aren't sniffed at all.
	* GL Projection changes. Not sure if it's for the better yet ;)
	* Clicking the map now uses gluUnProject(), so it works no matter
	  how the map is rotated or zoomed :)
	* Fixed some typos
	* Changed all player highlight colors around
	* Made invading players flash in the map
2001-12-15 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Added the drawing of rulers to aid navigation
	* Added option to rotate display so 'Up' on the map is whats 'ahead'
	  in the game.
	  Suggested by Sparr
	* Expanded the object sizes to three choices.
	* Made capture files include timestamp of packets, and playback
	  is now at normal speed.
	* If map information is available, all coordinates are remapped
	  to match the cooked ingame coordinates.
	* Began updates to the mob-is-stale detection.
	  Rest will wait until speed is decoded and implemented
2001-12-14 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>
	* Added oeHttpCopyFile -- QUrlOperator::copy() seems broken
	* Added the --realtime option. The new default is to 
	  not use realtime sniffing, just high priority one.
	  Apparantly this is better than realtime in some cases.
	  Thanks to Xy for finding this fact.
	* Added the player name to the caption of the window
	  Suggested by Jerry.
2001-12-13 Slicer <slicer@hackersquest.org>

	* Updated README and INSTALL
