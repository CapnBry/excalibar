Dec 27 2004:
99.96% (and growing) of these maps were (re)done by me. everything except:
Battleground.map
Cursed_Tomb.map
Tir-na_Nog_2.map
Tir-na_Nog.map
Tir_na_Nog3.map
Undead_Halls.map
Druid_Barrow.map

3 of those are obsolete, the others will get updates for Catacombs...

They are now used by mapper's everywhere. All I ask, is that if you use this
data that you give mention to Masta Mappa. There are many apps to view these:
the java based map editor.jar
the tcl/tk based map.tcl (under utils)
the script map2ps then using GNU's Ghostview
Otherwise, you can write your own app. 

Thanks, 
and enjoy the maps!

Feb  6  2002:
The maps used in conjunction with Odin's Eye were created, for the most part
by Mapfiend (As of the alpha release) using tools available on 
http://www.k-r-g.com/mapfiend . They are released under the GPL. You are free 
to do with them as you will, but if you create any maps, or make improvements 
to the existing ones, I ask that you please upload them to my site. Visit the
site often for the latest maps.
