The maps used in Excalibur have been contributed through Mapfiend (he has a
readme file in maps/Maps_Readme.txt).. You may also visit Mapfiend's site
directly at:  http://k-r-g.com/mapfiend

EX will store edited maps in the usermaps/ directory, and any maps stored in
this directory will override the default downloaded ones.

There's a small group of likeminded people hanging out in #Excalibur on
irc.trifocus.net if you're more into internet relayed chatting.

Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions. No support will
be given to people who do not follow the INSTALL instructions to the letter.
