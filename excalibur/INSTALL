                               Excalibur
         A real-time packet sniffer / analzyer for Dark Age of Camelot
===============================================================================

READ THIS FIRST
===============

If you fail to follow these simple installation instructions
TO THE LETTER, and then come whining on the boards or channels, expect to
be publicly ridiculed.

===================
System Requirements
===================

These are the general system requirements for the machine running EX.
These requirements assume that the machine isn't doing anything else, if
it is, adjust as required.

- Pentium 233Mhz
- SVGA Graphics card with at least 512 KiB memory, supported by your
- A recent UNIX release.. (i.e. Linux, Solaris, BSD, IRIX, or OSX)
- 64 MB Main Memory
- 256 MB Virtual Memory
- 750 MB free HD space (550 of which is for X11 / QT 3.0.4)

============================
Verifying your network setup
============================

You need to set up a sniffing environment. How to do that is
beyond the scope of this simple INSTALL file, but look around the
net; there are many guides.
To verify that your sniffing setup is correct, run the following command
on your would-be EX box WHILE playing DAoC:

tcpdump -n host <IP of your Windows Machine playing DAoC>

You should (hopefully) see two-way traffic, that is traffic both to AND
from your windows machine. If you don't, you don't have a sniffing
setup, and you should fix that first.

===============================
Checking your UNIX distribution
===============================

You absolutely, 100% sure, without a doubt need:
- A recent version of X11
- A copy of gcc 2.95, 2.96, or 3.0.3+
- An OpenGL impementation. Mesa will do fine.
- Libpcap. A version recent enough that it handles the cooked-mode "any" device.
- QT X11 Free version 3.0.1+

Prequsite packages for Mandrake 9.1
-----------------------------------
This is the distribution of choice for one of the developers (teerex). 
To begin with, you'll need a working X server and all of it's requisite
packages.  If you've installed KDE or GNOME as part of your install, you
most likely have a good base including QT.  In addition, you'll need the 
following packages from your distro CDs to build Excalibur:

  glibc-devel (cd1)
  gcc (cd1)
  gcc-cpp (cd1)
  gcc-c++ (cd1)
  libpcap0 (cd1)
  libpcap0-devel (cd2)
  Mesa (cd1)
  libMesaGL1 (cd1)
  libMesaGLU1 (cd1)
  libMesaGLU1-devel (cd3)
  libMesaglut3 (cd1)
  libMesaglut3-devel (cd3)
  XFree86-devel (cd1)

Under Mandrake 8.2:
  glibc-devel
  gcc-2.96
  gcc-cpp-2.96
  gcc-c++-2.96
  libpcap
  libpcap-devel
  Mesa
  libMesaGL1
  libMesaGLU1
  libMesaGLU1-devel
  libMesaglut3
  libMesaglut3-devel
  XFree86-devel

Under Mandrake 8.1, the libMesa* rpms are called:
  Mesa-common
  Mesa-common-devel
  
In addition, if you want to skip building qt 3, grab the qt3 packages from
ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/3.0.3/Mandrake/8.2/ or your friendly local 
kde mirror (note Mandrake 9.0 and above already have qt3):

  libqt3
  libqt3-devel

Installing under RedHat 7.2
---------------------------
This documentation is written with RH 7.2 in mind as the build platform..
If you installed RH 7.2 with "everything", the only thing you need to
update is QT to 3.0.1 or greater (instructions below).

If you did not install "everything" send us a list of packages you needed
to install and we will update this documentation.

Problems under RedHat 9.0
-------------------------
Reports on the forums indicate that RedHat 9's glut does not work properly
with Excalibur.  xsilentdx reports that if you update your glut and 
glut-devel rpms (RedHat 9 version) from rpmfind.net, everything works fine.

Prerequisite packages for Debian UNSTABLE
-----------------------------------------
  build-essential
  binutils
  task-c++-dev
  libpcap
  libpcap-dev
  libpng2
  libpng2-dev
  libqt3-mt
  libqt3-mt-dev
  qt3-tools
  xlibmesa3
  xlibmesa-dev
  zlib1g
  zlib1g-dev

  And make sure you have an X11 client configured (so you can actually
  see Excalibur when you run it!))

Prerequisites for Mac OSX
-------------------------
You MUST used Qt 3.1.1+, or the preferences code doesn't work. 

You may need the GLUT package installed, which you can found at:
http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Sample_Code/Graphics_3D/glut.htm
the other packages are the same as any other install.

================
Become superuser
================

If you're not already root, type "su" and fill in the superuser password
at the prompt.

===================
Installing QT 3.0.4
===================

*****
  If your distribution has a version of QT 3 and the development stuff 
  installed (for example,  libqt3 and libqt3-devel), you can skip this step.
*****

1) cd /usr/lib/
2) ncftpget ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/source/qt-x11-free-3.0.4.tar.gz
3) tar xvvfz qt-x11-free-3.0.4.tar.gz
4) mv qt-x11-free-3.0.4 qt-3.0.4
5) rm qt-x11-free-3.0.4.tar.gz
6) cd qt-3.0.4
7) export QTDIR=$(pwd)
8) ./configure -thread
9) make

Make will take a couple hours on a 1GHz machine. It's supposed to, so 
don't panic.

===================================
Downloading and compiling Excalibur
===================================

1) cd ~
2) cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.excalibar.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/excalibar co excalibur
3) export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-3.0.4
   If you're using your distribution's version of QT, then the above line
   is dependant on where your distro installed QT.  Usually /usr/lib/qt or
   /usr/lib/qt3 (Mandrake) or /usr/lib/qt-3.2 (RedHat 9).
4) cd excalibur
5) $QTDIR/bin/qmake excalibur.pro
6) 
   Under OSX: make -f Makefile.OSX
   Under other UNIXes: make

===================================
Generate Background Maps (optional)
===================================

Excalibur has support for displaying PNG map files as a backgrounds.
See README.convert for information on how to generate the PNG maps.

=================
Running Excalibur
=================

Method 1:  Use this if your DAoC machine and Excalibur machine are on a 
           hub (not a router or a switch)

1) cd ~/excalibur
2) ifconfig eth0 promisc     # Replace eth0 with whatever card you normally use
3) ./excalibur
See "Common" below

Method 2a:  Use this or 2b if you are on a switch/router and the Excalibur 
            machine doesn't "see" the DAoC traffic.  (Linux) means type the 
            command on you Excalibur machine, (Win) means type the command on 
            your DAoC Windows machine.  Replace 192.168.1.1 with the IP address
            of your Excalibur machine.  If the DAoC server you're connecting
            to is not on the 208.254.16.0 subnet, adjust accordingly.
            
1) (Linux) echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2) (Linux) iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 208.254.16.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.1
3) (Linux) cd ~/excalibur
4) (Linux) ./excalibur --exclude-local
5) (Win) route add 208.254.16.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
See "Common" below

Method 2b:  Use this or 2b if you are on a switch/router and the Excalibur 
            machine doesn't "see" the DAoC traffic.  Set up a SOCKS 5 server 
            on your Linux machine, and use a SOCKS socket intercept on the DAoC 
            machine.

1) cd ~/excalibur
2) ./excalibur
See "Common" below

Method OSX:
You run excalibur with `sudo ./excalibur.app/Contents/MacOS/excalibur`, 
without sudo it cannot access the sniffer. 

Common:
The program will display a few lines, but nothing else will happen.
==> This is as it should be. <==

Go to your windows machine and log on DAoC. You must not start the DAoC
Client before you start Excalibur, or you will get nothing!

The first time the window opens, you probably want to go to the "Settings"
menu and customize your configuration options.. There are numerous options
to be configured, I won't go into detail here.

For Best Performance, set your preferences like this.  The text in 
parentheses is how much of a performance hit you'll take for not 
selecting the suggested option.

======================
Running the Map Editor
======================

The map editor is a standalone Java program. This program is used to create
or modify the vector (line) maps that come with Excalibur.  You need at least 
JDK 1.3 to run it, but 1.4 or better is encouraged.

To see your java version, type:

java -version

To run the editor, make sure you have java installed (http://java.sun.com)
and type:

java -jar editor.jar


To get the editor to link to EX, you need to start EX like this:

./excalibur --link

When you connect to DAoC, the port number the editor needs will be show in
the window title of EX.
