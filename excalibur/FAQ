Q: There's no window popping up when I start EX?

A: You didn't read the INSTALL file.

==========

Q: Where are the map files?

A: If you run `cvs update' from your Excalibur CVSROOT, it will automatically
   download all the latest maps.

   Alternately, you can go directly to the homepage for vectorized DAOC maps,
   Mapfiend's excellent site at http://www.k-r-g.com/mapfiend

==========

Q: There's something about "no such device"?

A: Update your PCAP library. It needs to handle cooked mode, and it has to
   support the "any" device.

==========

Q: "No Direct Render - This will be SLOW", is that bad?!

A: To get accelerated GL support, you need to install the necesarry GL
   drivers. For NVidia cards, these can be found at http://www.nvidia.com

   For most other cards, you can use DRI (http://dri.sourceforge.net),
   which hopefully is included in your distribution.

   Note that accelerated OpenGL is by no means necesarry.

==========

Q: "The QT compile crashes at various points during the compile"?

A: If the error is nonrepeatable (that is, if you type "make" again it just
   magically works), you have hardware problems. Overclocked processors,
   cheap RAM, lousy chipsets all contribute to this.

==========

Q: What's bugreport.sh?

A: A tool for me to generate proper bug reports from core files. Don't use it
   unless you've been asked to.

==========

Q: Tesselation failed with <bla bla>

A: You have a broken GLU library. The application will still work flawlessly,
   but some polygons will not be filled correctly. As long as you're not a map
   designer, this will not bother you.

   If you ARE a map designer, please take care not to create self-intersecting
   polygons as that causes these kinds of problems for many users.

==========

Q: What's these gluTessBeginPolygon errors?

A: You have a recent version of the include file GL/GLU.h, but your library
   doesn't match it, so the program tries to link to the newstyle GLU functions,
   but they're not there. Please fix your GLU library.

==========

Q: The map editor complains that it needs Java 1.3, which I installed!

A: Yes, you did, but that's not the one you're running..

   Chances are there's some system-default java engine being run instead of
   your newly installed one. This can usually be fixed by using the full path
   to java, for example

    /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0/bin/java -jar editor.jar

==========

Q: When I star Excalibur, I get the error: "libgcc not found" while loading
   exCrypt.. What gives?

A: You need to install gcc 3.0+.. You should have done so at compile time, be-
   cause it's listed as a compile requirement! Did you neglect to read the
   INSTALL file?
